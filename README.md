ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently enrolled in a MSc Data Science programme, where I'm developing skills in statistics, programming, and data analysis.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Machine Learning and exploring how it can be used to develop predictive models and uncover insights in large datasets.

ðŸ’¼ In addition to my studies, I'm working part-time as a Data Engineer, where I'm responsible for designing, building and maintaining data pipelines and supporting data infrastructure.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source projects to enhance my skills and learn from others in the community.

ðŸ“« How to reach me: Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sebastian-rohr/). I'm always open to meeting new people and discussing data-related projects.
